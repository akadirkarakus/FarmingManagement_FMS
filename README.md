Some information about the project
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENTERING THE SYSTEM:
	You can enter the project as an admin or a personnel. Admins can reach every form on the program. Personnels can only reach the related parts of the program according to their workspaces. A personnel can work at least 1 workspace and maximum 2 workspaces. By this information, to measure all of the program skills, we suggest you to use below accounts in "suggested accounts" part to register system.


PASSWORDS: 
	All of the passwords are hashed before sending to database. So, you can not directly reach the password information of an employee by the database. When you create a new employee as an admin, the password of the new employee is geneterated by the system automatically as "surname+ID". (e.g. Surname: Wick, ID: 123456789, then password is Wick123456789) This passwrord can be changed by the employee by using the account manager interface later.



SUGGESTED ACCOUNT:
-Admin: 12345678910
password: 123456
